	<p>On the 26<sup>th</sup> October, 2011, the Vice Chancellor of the University of East Anglia, UK, announced that the findings of a secretly-held review were that the University should ‘not to invest further’ in creative musical education. The School was neither involved nor informed. The findings will be presented to the UEA Council and Senate on the 9<sup>th</sup> November, and the decision to accept or reject the findings will be taken on the 28<sup>th</sup> November.</p>

		<p>The School currently operates at 25% over target, the largest number of students it has ever had.</p> 
		<p>The School is criticised for not producing enough funding from research, earning £363,780 in the 2008 RAE.</p>
		<p>The School was, however, asked to prioritise teaching over research, which saw its National Student Survey score reach the 3<sup>rd</sup> highest in the UK.</p> 
		<p>It did not receive the extra staff it was promised to support its expansion with the new <em>Music and Technology</em> degree (now in its third year).</p> 
		<p>Despite this, the School has consistently out-ranked the University as a whole in The Guardian league table, reaching 5<sup>th</sup> in 2010 and 8<sup>th</sup> in 2011. The UEA is ranked 19th.</p> 
		<p>We ask that the Senate consider our defence and take the time to explore options rather than simply close an entire School.</p>
