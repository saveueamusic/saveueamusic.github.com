	<p>On the 26<sup>th</sup> October, 2011, the Vice Chancellor of the University of East Anglia, UK, announced the findings of a secretly-held, internal and non-specialist review: that the University should “not to invest further” in creative musical education. </p>	
	<p>The review neither involved nor informed the School. Its authors assert, for support, that their review is based on an external, subject-specialist review from 2002. Subsequently, the authors of the 2002 review have commented that references to their review are deliberately “selective” and “misleading”, and that, in their opinion, the “new review follows a familiar model where a department is set up to fail”, and that “the misuse of our report” is “very irritating”.</p>	
	<p>The 2002 review’s final conclusion was that “<em>The price of failure to invest … is, in our view, the loss of music as an academic subject at UEA, to the impoverishment of the University and the Nation</em>”.</p>	
	<p>The findings of the internal review were presented to the UEA Council and Senate on the 9<sup>th</sup> November, and the decision to accept or reject the findings will be taken on the 28<sup>th</sup> November.</p>

		<p>The School currently operates at 25% over target, the largest number of students it has ever had.</p> 
		<p>The School is criticised for not producing enough funding from research, earning £363,780 in the 2008 RAE.</p>
		<p>The School was, however, asked to prioritise teaching over research, which saw its National Student Survey score reach the 3<sup>rd</sup> highest in the UK.</p> 
		<p>It did not receive the extra staff it was promised to support its expansion with the new <em>Music and Technology</em> degree (now in its third year).</p> 
		<p>Despite this, the School has consistently out-ranked the University as a whole in The Guardian league table, reaching 5<sup>th</sup> in 2010 and 8<sup>th</sup> in 2011. The UEA is ranked 19<sup>th</sup>.</p> 
		<p>We ask that the Senate consider our defence and take the time to explore options rather than simply close an entire School.</p>
