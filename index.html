			<p>As you may or may not be aware, as of the 26th October, there is a very real danger to the entire School of Music at The University of East Anglia, with a recommendation ‘not to invest further’ in creative musical education being the finding of a review held in secret, without involving or informing the School until the review was concluded. This finding is being presented to the UEA Council and Senate on the 8th November, with the decision being made on the 28th November. <a href="#" onclick="$('#more_description').slideDown();$(this).remove()">more…</a></p>
			<div id="more_description" style="display:none">
				<p>Music is seen as being too small and UEA is not willing to invest further to increase its size, meaning redundancies for all staff and the end of any education in Music at UEA.</p> 
				<p>The department currently has the largest number of students it has ever had, operating at 25% over target.</p> 
				<p>The department is also criticised for not producing enough funding from research, despite achieving a 4 (on a scale form 0-4) for over £550k of research funding in the last national RAE in 2008.</p>
				<p>We have not had the members of staff promised to support our expansion through the new Music and Technology degree (now in it’s third year) and were asked to prioritise teaching the students over research, which saw our NSS score reach the 3rd highest in the UK.</p> 
				<p>We have consistently ranked much more highly than UEA as a whole in league tables, achieving 5th in 2010 and are currently 8th. UEA as a whole is at 19th.</p> 
				<p>We ask that the senate consider our defence and take the time to explore options other than completely wiping out an entire department.</p> 
				<p>We are a small department that punches well above its weight, and we have consistently improved on targets, despite no extra support from the University.</p>
