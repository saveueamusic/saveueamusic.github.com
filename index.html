	<p>On the 26<sup>th</sup> October, 2011, the Vice Chancellor of the University of East Anglia, UK, announced the findings of a secretly-held, internal and non-specialist review: that the University should “not to invest further” in creative musical education. </p>	
	<p>The review neither involved nor informed the School. Its authors assert, for support, that their review is based on an <a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/72371504/2002-Music-Review">external, subject-specialist review from 2002</a>. Subsequently, the authors of the 2002 review have commented that references to their review are deliberately “<a href="/files/2002_Panel_comments.pdf">selective</a>” and “<a href="/files/2002_Panel_comments.pdf">misleading</a>”, and that, in their opinion, the “<a href="/files/2002_Panel_comments.pdf">new review follows a familiar model where a department is set up to fail</a>”, and that “<a href="/files/2002_Panel_comments.pdf">the misuse of our report</a>” is “<a href="/files/2002_Panel_comments.pdf">very irritating</a>”.</p>	
	<p>Over {% include petition_count.html %} senior academics, noted musicians and composers, parents, students and local residents have signed the petition and <a href="http://support.saveueamusic.org/">spoken out against the proposal</a>.</p>
	<p>The decision to accept or reject the findings will be taken on the 28<sup>th</sup> November.</p>

		<p>The School currently operates at 25% over target, the largest number of students it has ever had.</p> 
		<p>The School is criticised for not producing enough funding from research, earning £363,780 in the 2008 RAE.</p>
		<p>The School was, however, asked to prioritise teaching over research, which saw its National Student Survey score reach the 3<sup>rd</sup> highest in the UK.</p> 
		<p>The 2002 review’s final conclusion was that “<em><a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/72371504/2002-Music-Review">The price of failure to invest … is, in our view, the loss of music as an academic subject at UEA, to the impoverishment of the University and the Nation</a></em>”.</p>	
		<p>The School did not receive the extra staff it was recommended (and promised) to support its expansion with the new <em>Music and Technology</em> degree (now in its third year).</p> 
		<p>Despite this, the School has consistently out-ranked the University as a whole in The Guardian league table, reaching 5<sup>th</sup> in 2010 and 8<sup>th</sup> in 2011. The UEA is ranked 19<sup>th</sup>.</p> 
		<p>We ask that the University consider our defence and take the time to explore more enterprising solutions rather than simply close an entire School.</p>
